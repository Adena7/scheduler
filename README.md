# Interview Scheduler

Using the latest tools and techniques, I built and test a React application that allows users to book, cancel and edit interviews throughout the weekdays. We combine a concise API with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience. Scheduler was built with an extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing using Jest, Storybook, and Cypress.

## Behavioural Features
- Interviews can be booked between Monday and Friday.
- A user can switch between weekdays.
- A user can book an interview in an empty appointment slot.
- Interviews are booked by typing in a student name and clicking on an interviewer from a list of available interviewers.
- A user can cancel an existing interview.
- A user can edit the details of an existing interview.
- The list of days informs the user how many slots are available for each day.
- The expected day updates the number of spots available when an interview is booked or canceled.
- A user is presented with a confirmation when they attempt to cancel an interview.
- A user is shown an error if an interview cannot be saved or deleted.
- A user is shown a status indicator while asynchronous operations are in progress.
- When the user presses the close button of the error they are returned to the Form or Show view (skipping Status and Confirm).
- The application makes API requests to load and persist data. We do not lose data after a browser refresh.
