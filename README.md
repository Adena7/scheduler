# Interview Scheduler

Using the latest tools and techniques, I built and test a React application that allows users to book, cancel and edit interviews throughout the weekdays. We combine a concise API with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience. Scheduler was built with an extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing using Jest, Storybook, and Cypress.
